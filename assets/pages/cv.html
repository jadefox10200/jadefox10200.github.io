				<h4 class="bio">My Story</h4>
				<h2 class="bio">BIO</h2>
				<p class="bio">
					I started professionally working at the age of 15. I left home, flew across the nation and landed my first job working on cruise ships in the Caribbean. Starting out as a deckhand I learned what I needed along the way both as a sailer and as a person. By the age of 18, I was the youngest fully qualified Quartermaster in the Caribbean. This is where I learn life skills, learned to manage others and make decisions that could affect the lives of everyone aboard that vessel. Needless to say, I got very accustom to directing others and managing at a very young age.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					At the age of 20 I moved back home after 5 years at sea. I got a job as a receptionist at a local Real Estate office. There, I put to use the skills I learned at sea, both as a teammate and executive. After learning the industry a bit, I proposed a new production concept for the office completely different than any other known office. The summary of the implementation of my written out plans was that in 2 years the company expanded dramatically increasing the monthly income by a factor of 50. When I left, I was managing half the company running a team of seven people.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					At the age of 23 I then moved to LA in order to marry my wife. I got a job at a print shop that had not yet been built. I was tasked with the duty of purchasing all materials that would be needed to build a 185,000 square foot print facility throughout the renovations. I was then given an entry level position at the print shop and by the time production began I was the head of one of three divisions. In my time there I have literally manufactured hundreds of millions of print items and won four industry awards for quality. I am personally trained in all post-print production manufacturing while additionally qualified to print T-shirts. I also created innovative methods of manufacturing which dropped production times of certain jobs from 4 hours to 30 minutes.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					Summary:
					In each field I have gone to work in, I have started out with no prior knowledge, education or skill in that field. I have a high desire to learn, innovate, collaborate with others and produce high quality products all with the goal of getting more done in less time, utilizing as few resources as possible.
