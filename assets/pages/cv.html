				<h4 class="bio">My Story</h4>
				<h2 class="bio">BIO</h2>
				<p class="bio">
					I started professionally working at the age of 15. I left home, flew across the nation and landed my first job working on cruise ships in the Caribbean. Starting out as a deckhand I learned what I needed along the way both as a sailer and as a person. By the age of 18, I was the youngest fully qualified Quartermaster in the Caribbean. This is where I learn life skills, learned to manage others and make decisions that could affect the lives of everyone aboard that vessel. Needless to say, I got very accustom to directing others and managing at a very young age.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					At the age of 20 I moved back home after 5 years at sea. I got a job as a receptionist at a local Real Estate office. There, I put to use the skills I learned at sea, both as a teammate and executive. After learning the industry a bit, I proposed a new production concept for the office completely different than any other known office. The summary of the implementation of my written out plans was that in 2 years the company expanded dramatically increasing the monthly income by a factor of 50. When I left, I was managing half the company running a team of seven people.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					At the age of 23 I then moved to LA in order to marry my wife. I got a job at a print shop that had not yet been built. I was tasked with the duty of purchasing all materials that would be needed to build a 185,000 square foot print facility throughout the renovations. I was then given an entry level position at the print shop and by the time production began I was the head of one of three divisions. In my time there I have literally manufactured hundreds of millions of print items and won four industry awards for quality. I am personally trained in all post-print production manufacturing while additionally qualified to print T-shirts. I also created innovative methods of manufacturing which dropped production times of certain jobs from 4 hours to 30 minutes.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					Summary:
					In each field I have gone to work in, I have started out with no prior knowledge, education or skill in that field. I have a high desire to learn, innovate, collaborate with others and produce high quality products all with the goal of getting more done in less time, utilizing as few resources as possible.

							I'm a self taught developer. I learned through books, projects, CS50, Udemy, building
							applications, working with other developers and the like. To see my full list of studies,
							please visit my github repository here: <br><br /> <a class="pgm" href="https://github.com/jadefox10200/My-Code-Path/blob/master/How-I-Learn.md">How I Learned Programming</a>

						<h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">PROJECTS</h2>
						<p>
							While working at the print shop there was a huge need for
							automation in order to get more production through the shop. It was here where I discovered
							my passion for the subject. As the print world is very secluded and competitive, I
							won't be able to post any of those projects as they're very innovative. Some of the applications
							I made saved executives of the shop 3 days of work each week.
